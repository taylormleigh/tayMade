            {`Hello! I'm Tay, a front-end engineer with experience building full-stack apps. I have completed projects primarily using the SERN stack. My background is in animation and illustration, which nurtured instincts in art and design that I leverage to effectively sharpen my skills as a designer and engineer. Whether working on small personal projects from scratch or jumping onto bigger projects to help support a team, I like to approach programming with energy, excitement, and an eye for detail. Feel free to contact me for inquiries and opportunities!`}
