            {`Hello! I'm Tay and I am a software engineer proficient in building full-stack apps, with a strong focus toward front-end engineering. I have completed projects primarily using the SERN stack. My background is in animation and illustration, which nurtured instincts in art and design that I leverage to effectively sharpen my skills as a designer and engineer. Many of my personal hobbies involve an element of creative problem solving and working through puzzles, which initially led me to programming and has kept me passionate about what I do.`}

I am currently seeking engineering roles at a solid company that I can grow in, though I am open to contract work depending on the project.`}
